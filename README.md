Unit 2 - Store Management Project

## Introduction

You are opening a new business in your community! Businesses often need programs to manage the products and services they offer and track orders and requests from customers. Your goal is to create a store management system for your business.

## Requirements

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming and class structure and design to create your store management system:
- **Create a class hierarchy** – Develop a superclass that represents a product or service your business offers and one or more subclasses that extend the superclass to represent more specific types of products or services.
- **Declare instance variables** – Declare instance variables in the superclass that are shared with the subclasses and instance variables in the subclasses that are not shared with the superclass.
- **Write constructors** – Write no-argument and parameterized constructors in the superclass and subclasses. Subclass constructors use the super keyword to call the superclass constructor.
- **Implement accessor and mutator methods** – Write accessor and mutator methods for instance variables that should be accessible and/or modifiable from outside of the class.
- **Implement a toString() method** – Write toString() methods in the superclass and subclasses that return information about the state of an object.

## Description

My store is a Snowgear rental shop. I chose this topic because I like snowboarding and its about to be winter time soon. The project uses object oriented programming with a main class SnowGear and two subclasses which consists of Snowboard and Skis. This shows how the subclasses cna inherit common features while differing due to the objects. Users can interact with the system through GearInteraction where they can enter the type of gear, price, brand, and availability. It takes the input to create objects and it aims to make it easier to find the data for the right size and type of ski or snowboard that will be used!
